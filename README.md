# projectDrome
projectDrome is an experiment in creating 3D graphics using only the 2D context of the JavaScript canvas.  If this experiment proves successful, its functionality will be added to the Ludix game engine.

Update: Succesful! Now it's time for cleanup and optimisation, in preperation for transfer to Ludix.js.

Fixed texture gaps due to canvas antialiasing.  Now I won't have to switch to the more accurate, but much slower, raycast rendering technique.
